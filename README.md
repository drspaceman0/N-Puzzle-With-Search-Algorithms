# N-Puzzle-With-Search-Algorithms

For my AI class, I made an N-Puzzle in Python which utilized search algorithms to solve it. The algorithms are Breadth-First, Breadth-First with closed list, Depth-First with closed list, A* with Manhattan Heuristic, and A* with NOTO heuristic. The program also contains a GUI, and a function to export solving data to an excel document.
